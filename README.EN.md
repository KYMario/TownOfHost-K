## [Wiki](https://github.com/KYMario/TownOfHost-K/wiki)

## Release
AmongUs version : **17.0.0**~<br>

**The latest version is[Here](https://github.com/KYMario/TownOfHost-K/releases/latest)**<br>
Previous versions are [Here](https://github.com/KYMario/TownOfHost-K/releases)<br>

## About Public Rooms
> [!Note]
> In the version, you cannot open public rooms on vanilla servers via the official Among Us client.<br>

> [**Note**]
> - 【Reason】<br>
> - We believe the main cause is the numerous inquiries received by AmongUs official regarding specifications and bugs in HostMod (including Mode) rooms.<br>
> - We are also issuing a warning to prevent users from experiencing **unintended Mod experiences**.<br>

- This is not a permanent change.<br>
- It does not affect private rooms.<br>
- It does not affect custom servers.<br>
● Please refrain from contacting us regarding issues like being unable to open public rooms.<br>

## Opening recruitment rooms, recruiting, or joining via recruitment is strictly prohibited.
**Prohibited Actions**<br>
> [**Note**]
> - ・Creating a private Mod room and sharing its access code in a public room, potentially allowing public room users to join that private room.
> - (Examples)
> - Room owners creating public rooms using sub-accounts and recruiting users to private rooms from there.
> - Participants creating public rooms using sub-accounts and recruiting users to private rooms from there.
> - Room owners or participants joining public rooms and recruiting users to private rooms from there.

=> This is to prevent public room users from experiencing unintended Mod activities.<br>


**Permitted Activities**
> [**Note**]
> - Sharing private room codes in Discord to host Mod rooms among friends
> - via Town Of Host-K matchmaking
> - Participatory/private village streams on YouTube or similar platforms that do not involve the above prohibited activities<br>

=> In short, it is a violation if there is a possibility that **random players unaware of the Mod's existence might join**.<br>
<br>
If you encounter a recruitment room, do not join it indiscriminately. Please notify the developers first. We will handle it strictly.<br>

## Punishments and Usage Restrictions in TOH-K
Starting with version 5.1.61.1, we have implemented the blacklist functionality used in certain MODs, such as [SuperNewRoles](https://github.com/SuperNewRoles/SuperNewRoles/), into Town Of Host-K.

> [!note]
> - [Punishable Acts]
> - ・Actions equivalent to the aforementioned recruitment rooms or recruitment behavior
> - ・Disruptive behavior deemed inappropriate and punishable by the developers

Players engaging in the above will be added to the blacklist at the MOD developers' discretion.<br>
**Participation in or hosting of rooms using MODs that apply the blacklist will be permanently or temporarily restricted.**<br>

**★Note: Friend codes are now required to create rooms.★**<br>

-----------------------------------------------



**【You Must Read This】**<br>
By using Town Of Host-K, you pledge not to engage in any actions listed under “Punishable Usage Methods”.<br>
Should you engage in punishable usage, you agree to accept punishment under any circumstances.<br>

-----------------------------------------------

In short,<br>
if you engage in any of the actions listed in the [Punishable Usage Methods] above,<br>
you will lose access to the mod!<br>
If you use this mod, you must accept losing access to it,<br>
and you must not engage in any punishable usage methods!!<br>

## What is TownOfHost-K?
It's a mod packed with innovative and unique features and roles that sets it apart from other Among Us mods.

As a HostMod, only the room owner needs to install the mod.
Players don't need to install anything or go through the hassle of adding custom servers.
Simply join the room created by the installer to play TownOfHost-K!
